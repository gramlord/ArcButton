The ArcButton library allows you to easily handle tactile buttons.

This library uses the ArcSched scheduler to debounce the button, and
provides you with simple call-backs for button presses and releases,
as well as giving you the option to check the state of the button.

Your button must be attached to a pin on one side and ground on
the other. An internal pullup resister is used to pull the pin
HIGH will is is not pressed. Pressing the button will ground the pin
and hence it will read LOW.

You require one ArcButton instance for each button you have,
and one ArcSched instance that is shared between all ArcButton instances.
